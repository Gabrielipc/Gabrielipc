- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gabrielipc
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all the things I can, music is my passion although I don't know how to play any instrument
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code by my own 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I could be helpful
- 📫 How to reach me is pretty simple, just send me a message, even if it's not for a project, I like to meet new people
